# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
Data Analytics project showcasing EDA on Customer Behaviour using Python, Sql and Power BI
# Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data analysis using Python and PostgreSQL, culminating in a comprehensive Power BI dashboard. The steps include data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, running SQL queries, building a Power BI dashboard, creating a report, and generating a PowerPoint presentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Customer shopping behavior. It includes 3900 rows and 19 columns, covering various attributes such as Categories, Items_purchased, gender, purchase_amount and so  on.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas)
- PostgreSQL
- Power BI


## Steps
1. **Loading Dataset in Python**: 
   - Import the dataset using pandas.
   - Display the first few rows for initial inspection.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the distribution of key variables.
   - Visualize data using charts and graphs.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Remove duplicates and outliers.
   - Standardize data formats.

4. **Running SQL Queries on PostgreSQL**:
   - Connect to the PostgreSQL database.
   - Write and execute SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

5. **Building a Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Import cleaned data into Power BI.
   - Create interactive visualizations and reports.

The Power BI dashboard provides an interactive interface for stakeholders to explore and understand the data. It includes various visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables that summarize the key findings.

The project successfully demonstrates the ability to load, clean, analyze, and visualize data using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The insights gained from the analysis are presented in a clear and concise report, supported by a professionally designed PowerPoint presentation.
